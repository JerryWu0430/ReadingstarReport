                    Our app provides a smooth and streamlined user experience, and we believe that we have achieved our goal of an exciting, accessible game. At its very base, React Native has allowed us to build an intuitive and responsive application. 
                    On the main game screen, the use of bright colours, big buttons, all while conforming to familiar app layouts, means players need just one click to begin singing. Meanwhile, our focus mode and theme selector for performances takes gameplay 
                    to a completely new level, allowing players to completely lock into their performanceWe also have settings available to adjust features like fonts, and their sizing, colours, and more, and the scoring visibility can be toggled at any moment.

                <h3>Functionality</h3>
                <div class="evaluation-details">
                  <p>Our aim was to provide an application which allowed users of any demographic to easily improve their speech by performing karaoke with their desired song, providing real-time feedback and rewards based on similarity. We achieved this, and managed to build on this with further analysis on the recording of their voice during the song to finally score their overall performance.</p>

                  <p>The Whisper model we utilised for transcription and analysis in this project is world-leading in terms of performance and WER, when standardized for all demographics, but unfortunately its limitations for live ASR emerged in this project.</p>

                  <p>One point of note was its occasional inaccuracy for medium-length or incomplete phrases. Due to this, perfectly valid speech to the human ear would not be deemed similar enough to the lyric in real-time, and subsequently not be awarded in-game points. This is because the model adapts transcriptions based on the surrounding context, which it is starved of in the short window for the lyric matching (no more than a few seconds). Therefore, the final accuracy score presented at the end of a song is always the better (and correct) performance assessment, compared to the points score.</p>

                <h3>Stability</h3>
                <div class="evaluation-details">
                  <p>The project as a whole is now very stable, though at times during development it demonstrated quite volatile behaviour. For example, developing a React Native front-end for Windows suffers from a limited range of libraries which required us to find tricky workarounds for seemingly simple tasks, such as microphone access. Furthermore, the app was prone to crashes in the early stages of UI development, usually due to errors such as failed library imports or buttons disappearing at runtime, despite being present in the code. However, as we became familiar with the platform, these spontaneous errors decreased in frequency and we are very confident that the current application is robust enough to handle a vast range of events.</p>

                <div class="evaluation-details">
                  <p>For our project, additional efficiency was provided by Intel’s OpenVINO inference pipeline. As demonstrated in the performance testing section, OpenVINO provides optimised performance at no cost to speed, and thus uses less power as a result. This is critical for users, especially on laptops, who can still run the model at great speed without having to worry about excessive power usage.</p>

                  <p>ReadingStar aims for low latency inference for real time ASR, making the NPU the most suitable inference device. This is because the NPU excels at low-latency and energy efficient inference whereas the GPU is optimised for parallel, high-throughput tasks, which is more suitable for training and less ideal for real time inference tasks.</p>

                    Throughout the course of our project, our team was very interactive over every channel. Outside of the lab sessions which we all maintained consistent attendance to, we would plan and discuss the execution of solutions over our WhatsApp group chat, 
                    and by logging our progress on GitHub with issues, descriptive commits, and thorough code reviews.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through all these media, we would delegate or share responsibilities for upcoming tasks, holding each other accountable and working quickly to maintain 
                    steady progress. In addition, our team was very flexible in terms of roles, with each member contributing to all aspects of the project. This was particularly useful when one member was struggling with a task, as another could step in and provide assistance.

                    Our agile approach as the requirements evolved, from feedback at the BETT Conference to the comments of pupils at the Helen Allison School, was kept streamlined through receptive communication on the WhatsApp group chat again. We 
                    also made sure to check off objectives at regular points in development, and keep the Gantt chart updated.

                  <h4>UI design</h4>
                  <p>
                    While our choice of UI framework was made with utmost accessibility and compatibility in mind, React Native’s limitations posed challenges throughout the project. 
                    Despite our strong UX and ease of use, this was the result of the tireless work of our team to implement plenty of innovative and creative features, all while integrating a Python API into a stubborn front-end framework. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to React Native Windows possessing fewer available libraries than its iOS and Android frameworks, this meant we faced issues like the inability to open or close the microphone inside the app, and had to work around this with FastAPI. 
                    This was just one of many additional efforts we placed on the Python API.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, for our project, React Native was one of the only feasible options because we required a responsive, modern, and flexible UI, without sacrificing compatibility. We do note that…
                  </p>
                  <h4>Playlist storage and handling</h4>
                  <p>
                    Playlists were stored with atomic songs, inside a JSON file, which had fully-functional CRUD operations. However, this meant that the file was not normalised, meaning that you had to duplicate each 
                    song entry to add it to a new playlist. To improve this limited storage function, we could split the file into two, one storing songs, and the other containing playlist names and entries, similar 
                    to a database. Therefore, each song would be assigned a unique key and would only need to be referred to by ID to be loaded from a playlist, so no duplicated entries are required. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, a song’s YouTube URL is not shown to the user if loaded from a pre-saved playlist, which means that it is difficult to 
                    add a song already stored to a new playlist. To solve this, we could take a different approach by adding a trivial function 
                    (maybe presented as a checkbox in settings or near the URL input bar) to show it, if a user so wished.
                  </p><br>
                </div>
              </div>

              <div class="extension-possibilities mt-4">
                <h3>Extension Possibilities</h3>
                <div class="extension-details">
                  <h4>Additional performance feedback</h4>
                  <p>
                    Our final score provides very accurate feedback on the singing performance of a user. 
                    In the future, we could expand on this by providing more detail on the accuracy per lyric. 
                    This is already stored after the Whisper model transcription. Thus, we may once again use a 
                    sequence matcher to highlight the best and worst speech of the song, and present them in the 
                    application, using appropriate colour grading. This would allow educators and students alike 
                    to identify the most difficult pronunciations, which would aid future speech practice.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Automatic difficulty classification by song</h4>
                  <b><em>Note this differs to the difficulty selector already featured in-game, and would not replace it, rather complement it.</em></b><br>
                  <p>
                    Throughout the course of our project, and underscored in our user acceptance testing phase, we 
                    noticed the range in difficulty of songs played. Slower songs, such as nursery rhymes, were 
                    easier to perform than high-tempo songs, such as those featured on Disney soundtracks. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One way to improve UX when performing is to calculate the speed of the song upon receipt of the 
                    lyrics, using a measure such as the average of lyric length / lyric interval. Then, we would 
                    compare this to a preset threshold which would automatically classify the song in categories 
                    such as starter, challenging, or ultimate difficulty. This would be presented to the user at 
                    a suitable point, such as before playing the song or next to the score graphic. It would 
                    provide the user an additional opportunity to select a suitable threshold for the in-game 
                    difficulty scoring threshold.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Leaderboard, and Multiplayer Versus Mode</h4>
                  <p>
                    A locally-stored leaderboard would provide additional competitive incentive when practising 
                    with the game. We could add an arcade-style leaderboard in a JSON file, where the top 5 
                    performances per song and difficulty are scored, and the player is prompted to add theirs if 
                    high enough. This would be a great way to encourage replayability and competition amongst the
                    individual using ReadingStar.
                  </p>

                    Additionally, a heavily-requested feature from our visit to the Helen Allison School was a 
                    multiplayer mode, where users could compete with each other on who sings the most accurately. 
                    This could be implemented with a multiple-microphone setup, and modifications to the back-end 
                    to record multiple performances concurrently. We would only need the existing model pipeline 
                    for transcription, as it already processes vocal input into transcribed data and could 
                    incorporate multiple inputs into its queue. A shared results screen at the end of each session 
                    could highlight individual performances and declare a winner based on overall accuracy. One 
                    point of note is that further noise reduction techniques may be necessary, particularly in 
                    environments with multiple audio sources, such as a noisy classroom.

                Overall, we can undoubtedly classify our project work as a success, as we hit all objectives set out and extended on multiple, 
                and the application is nearing a stable release to the Microsoft Store. Most importantly though, feedback from users, 
                especially at the Helen Allison School, one of the institutions most invested in the app’s development, was overwhelmingly positive. 
                Anthony and Jerry had the wonderful opportunity to see the children, who will be using this, having fun performing songs with ReadingStar, 
                and we hope this is the seed for a revolution in accessible speech therapy.
